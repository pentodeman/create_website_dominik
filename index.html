                <h2>About me</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>I'm a junior at <a href="https://www.ttu.edu" class="highlight-link" target="_blank">Texas Tech University</a> majoring in Computer Engineering. This area of study is perfect for me as it combines hardware design and fabrication with low level software and firmware development. I tend to focus on the hardware side of things, but I am also competent in software development in languages like C and C++, Python, and Assembly for embedded devices. I am also good at FPGA development and prototyping in Verilog.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>During my time at Tech, I've maintained a 4.0 GPA while completing school projects, and most importantly, the personal ones. My main interest is circuit design. I focus on analog video and audio processing, but I also design digital electronics. My most recent project is a VGA frontend circuit capable of processing and amplifying color analog video, detecting sync polarity, and driving XY displays by generating a raster scan synchronized with the video signal. I've also recently designed a dynamic microphone preamplifier for my Rode PodMic designed to be mounted on my DIY microphone arm that attaches to my monitor mount with 3D-printed hardware. My most recent digital project is a macro keypad designed to natively emulate keystrokes and print text as an HID device. I'm planning to implement shortcuts and key combinations in the code and write a Linux kernel driver that would handle displaying feedback information as a screen overlay when cycling through the 15 text and symbol presets. I also made an automated water pump for my 5 gallon water jug that has had an uptime of over a year and prevented many spills while supplying my high water demand of gallons per week. It detects the presence of a water bottle under its outlet and dispenses the set amount with one press of a button. While dispensing water, it measures the dispensed amount using a strain gauge. It implements numerous safety checks to only pour into an empty container. This has by far been my most used DIY tool. I also enjoy truck simulators in VR as a hobby, and for it I made a custom shifter knob with split and range selectors that interacts with the game as a gamepad. This allows me to shift trucks as it is done in real life in a truck with a manual transmission up to 16 gears. My most notable programming project is a video stream scraper written in Python that I've maintained for over 5 years now. It is a tool made purely for fun to learn about video streaming techniques and how they are implemented in network. Disclaimer: this project is only used educationally, in a white hat fashion on my own, self-hosted video streams on a local server that implements common streaming protocols. This project also taught me a lot about threaded code, subprocesses, and GUI programming using the QT6 toolkit. Another project I enjoyed writing was a simple schedule display program that displays my school schedule in an asthetically pleasing CLI table. I wrote it in object-oriented C++ while taking my OOP class to experience OOP in a real language. Yes, I'm not a fan of Java. Today I'll be working on implementing a schedule builder for this project to avoid writing schedule files with custom formatting by hand.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>I spend most of my time working on electronics, programming, and CAD projects. I usually combine all of those skills in my projects to create different, more or less useful devices. Outside of that, I also enjoy customizing and streamlining my computing experience. Of course, all of my computers run Linux by default with only my desktop being allowed having a Windows drive for occasional light gaming. As required by the distro I use, I must say that "I use Arch btw." I enjoy customizing my environment as much as possible. My current setup consists of Arch Linux (6.12.8-arch1-1 kernel) with an i3 tiling window manager running on X11. My favorite terminal emulator is Kitty, though my friends seem to disagree with my life choices. For CAD, I prefer not to boot into Windows as my computer takes around 1.5 minutes to boot due to my memory size and type, so I opt to run it in a Windows virtual machine with hardware acceleration. In the past, I used to run it it a VM with single GPU passthrough, but this approach was not very stable due to the GPU I use and my IOMMU grouping. I am currently considering buying a second, low power workstation GPU for testing.</p>
